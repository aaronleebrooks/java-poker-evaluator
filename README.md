#Java Poker Hand Evaluator

Howdy. This is a recreation of the coding challenge I had taken on Friday with JavaScript, but using Java instead. I originally coded this in another HackerRank, but decided that moving it over to its own repo would help me showcase my skills in being able to create tests in Java, as well as hosting and integrating Java with TravisCI.

## Getting Started and Running Tests

Feel free to clone the repo and run the tests locally. Additionally, I integrated with TravisCI for continuous testing.
